# Edge-Deployable AI Planner

** This branch provides a separate environment to address issues in the main branch, including fixing the broken CI/CD pipeline, adding unit tests, refactoring the codebase for modularity, building Docker containers, integrating MLC-LLM deployment, extending benchmarking coverage, and improving the agentic flow by introducing a routing step after the input prompt. **
