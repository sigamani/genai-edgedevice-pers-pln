# Edge-Deployable AI Planner

**ðŸ“Œ Note: Purpose of This Branch**

This branch serves as a separate environment to address and improve several areas of the main branch, including:

- Fixing the broken CI/CD pipeline  
- Adding unit tests for core functionality  
- Refactoring the codebase for improved modularity  
- Building and containerising the application with Docker  
- Integrating deployment via MLC-LLM  
- Extending and automating benchmarking processes  
- Enhancing the agentic workflow by adding a routing step post-input prompt  

These changes aim to create a cleaner, more maintainable, and production-ready codebase.
